Implement the Timer

1. implement the next branch that uses standalone components for lazy loading instead of new modules. And maybe removing app.module all together.

2. Implement a branch from that converts the conditional syntax, introduces some signals, inlines templates and css, and updates the angular schematics.

3. Implement a branch from that that shows how signal store can be used. Possibly try to incorporate a dispatcher and some actions.
